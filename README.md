# Case Study: Trulioo, one of Canada's leading RegTech companies
#
## Overview and Origin
### Trulioo is a RegTech company that provides a global identity marketplace. It was founded in 2011 by Stephen Ufford and Tanis Jorge. The pair had initially started their venture in 1999, launching the first of their Tech businesses IQuiri which they sold in 2003. They subsequently built and sold two more tech companies.
### During their foray into the tech industry, they recognized the limitations of identity verification and the prevalence of online fraud. This provided the impetus for them to create Trulioo.
#
## Business Activities
### Trulioo provides a platform for providing real-time identity and business verification for 5 billion people and 330 million businesses worldwide through its bank-grade identity verification marketplace, GlobalGateway.
### GlobalGateway uses Software as a Service (SaaS) as well as a web portal for its services. It has Application Programming Interface (API) with a normalised set of data fields across 195 countries. GlobalGateway can also be customized to adhere to global, regional, and national rules or regulations for compliance.
### The company's services help prevent or mitigate digital fraud and has wathclist tie-ins with multiple international watchlists.
#
## Landscape
### Canada is considered globally as the leader in RegTech. This is primarily due to government initiative and a diverse talent pool. Furthermore, deregulation by the United States as well as political shifts in the UK has contributed to Canada taking the lead.
### Even before the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic, there has been a trend to a shift to digital transactions globally. Now, even when the pandemic dies down, it is projected that there will be a downward trend on face-to-face transactions. Currently, Trulioo's clients include major banking, payments, eCommerce, and other financial services such as Interactive Brokers, Kick Starter, American Express, and Paypal, among others. Along with Agreement Express and VigilantCS, Trulioo is considered as among Canada's most exciting RegTech companies.
### MarketsandMarkets consideres the industry as worth $7.6 Billion and estimates that its worth will double in 2025.
#
## Results
### The company is listed in the website fintech.global as one of the 100 most innovative RegTech companies as well as ventureradar.com's list of top RegTech companies. 
### Trulioo is backed by investment from significant financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Mouro Capical, American Express and Citi Ventures. It also partners with data sources and verification partners for its services.
#
## Recommendations
### To further expand its capabilities, Trulioo should venture into the field of Legal Tech. Legal Technology which in itself is very disruptive aims to provide access to the Legal Industry through technology. Since Trulioo provides services globally, it could incorporate local legal services into its services offered. This would provide technical expertise on regulation compliance for each individual country it offers its services to. Furthermore, knowledge of the legal nuances of each different jurisdiction would make Trulioo a one-stop-shop platform for regulation compliance.
